# basic YAML syntax
# Maps/Dictionaries (YAML calls it mapping)
# the content of a mapping node is an unordered set of key/value node pairs, wuth th restriction that each of the keys
# is unique. YAML places no further restrictions on the nodes.

# Arrays/Lists (YAML calls them sequences)
# the content of a sequence node is an ordered series of zero or more nodes. In particular, a sequence may contain
# the smae node more than once. it could even contain itself

#Literals (Strings, numbers, boolean, etc)
# the content of a scaler node is an opaque datum that can be presented as a series of zero or more Unicode characters

# key: value [mapping]
company: myCompany

# key: value is an array [sequence]

# Advanced YAML syntax
# A single YAML file can have more than one document.
# Each document can be interpreted as a separate YAML file which means multiple documents can contain the same
# or duplicate keys which are not allowed in the same document 
# A YAML file with multiple documents would look like this, where each new document is indicated by ---.
